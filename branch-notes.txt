Branch Notes – Git Practice

This document is created to practice working with branches in Git.

Branch details:
- main       : Contains stable and merged code
- Repository : Used for adding and testing new files
- Newbranch  : Experimental changes

What I learned:
- Each branch has its own version of files
- Files created in one branch do not appear in another branch automatically
- git merge is required to bring files into another branch

Steps practiced:
1. Switched to Repository branch
2. Created this text file
3. Added and committed the file
4. Switched back to main branch
5. Merged Repository into main branch

Key reminder:
- Always commit changes before merging
- Always checkout the target branch before merge

This file is only for learning and practice.
