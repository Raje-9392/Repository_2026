Git Learning Notes

This is my first Git practice file.
I am learning Git using Command Prompt (CMD).

Topics I am learning:
- What is Git
- Git init
- Git add
- Git commit
- Git status
- Git push and pull

Git is used to track changes in files.
GitHub is used to store code online.

This file is created for Git practice.
