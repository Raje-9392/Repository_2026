Git Merge Example Notes

This file is created to understand how git merge works.

Scenario:
- main branch contains stable code
- feature branch contains new changes
- feature branch is merged into main branch

Steps followed:
1. Created a new branch called feature
2. Added this file in feature branch
3. Committed the changes
4. Switched back to main branch
5. Merged feature into main branch

Key learning:
- Always checkout the target branch before merging
- git merge brings changes from one branch into another
- Conflicts occur if the same file is modified in both branches

Best practice:
- Test code before merging
- Resolve conflicts carefully
- Use clear commit messages

This document is only for Git learning and practice.
