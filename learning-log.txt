Git Learning Log

Date: Day 1
Tool: Git using Command Prompt (CMD)

Today I learned:
- How to initialize a Git repository
- How to check file status using git status
- What untracked files mean
- How to stage files using git add
- How to commit changes using git commit

Important notes:
- Git does not track files automatically
- Files must be added before committing
- Commit messages should be clear and meaningful

Next steps:
- Practice git diff
- Learn git pull and git fetch
- Understand branching and merging

This file is created only for learning and practice.
